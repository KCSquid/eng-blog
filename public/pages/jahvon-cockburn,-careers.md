$$All About Me$$
Hey, welcome to my personal blog site for my civics & careers class. My name is Jahvon Cockburn, I am 15 years old and I'm attending high school in grade 10. Growing up in multiple cities, I've been exposed to multiple languages (mainly both English and French) through diverse environments. These expierences have enriched my background and given me the opportunity to find new interests and turn me into who I am today. My biggest interest, computers, started early in my life during just the second grade. The computer program by MIT, "Scratch", sparked a deep enthusiasm for coding that continues to grow as I get older and learn more. I learn best with visual and kinesthetic styles, which help me at my very motivated, curious, and opportunistic personality. I aim to continue to grow personally and academically in the coming years.

$$Personality$$
After taking the Myers-Briggs 16 Personalities test, I have concluded that I have the type ENTP-A (Assertive, Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Perceiving). Intellectual and creative problem solving challenges are all very enjoyable for me, and help me thrive to become better, especially when related to technology (or more specifically coding). Sharing my ideas is easy for me with my natural outgoing and confident nature, but it may lead to me being **too** passionate or blunt when I debate with others. I'm always energetic and enthusiastic when faced with new challenges or ideas, but if I'm **overly** passionate, I'll come off as insensitive about some topics. Overall, I find great strength that prepare me for my future innovtive, strategical, and creative careers, but I also know my weaknesses and how I can work on myself. 

$$Interests & Hobbies$$
I have a lot of interests! People that know me well understand that I dabble in all sorts of skills, making me a very well rounded person, but like every other human, I have some focus.

**Main Passion - Coding**
Fluent in:
- Scratch (My first)
- Python (My best)
- JavaScript & Typescript (My most used)
- Golang (Short & Quick projects [yet efficient])
- Java (Robotics)
- Always learning more!

**Other Interests:**
- Engineering, crafting, building, etc.
- Biking, walking, swimming and all active outdoors activities
- Volunteering in any way I can. (Hoping to build as many hours as I can for fun!)
- Language learning (1100+ day streak on Duolingo). Currently exploring German and improving my French.

$$Awards and Certifications$$
- üèÜ Solo Hackathon Winner ‚Äì I won my school's first ever hackathon in grade six, standing out from the competition. I won a brand new Raspberry Pi 4 which I continue to use often for side-projects.
- üèÜ Oware Tournament Champion ‚Äì My school board's Oware tournament. I ended up victorious over a board-wide contest of 60 students.

- üìú Certificate of Distinction ‚Äì from the University of Waterloo‚Äôs Canadian Computing Competition (CCC), recognizing high achievement in programming skills. Top 25%.

$$Facts / Summary$$
- Self taught coder - learned at a very young age
- Actively working on myself - aiming to become better in any way I can
- Highly adaptable - thrived throughout multiple cities and environments
- Values - helping others, creativity, problem-solving, dedication to learn
- Clear goals - career in programming or tech is likely

# Pathway One - Computer Science
$$High School Courses$$
To pursue my Computer Science pathway, I'll need to (or I'm recommended to) take various courses including:
- Grade 11 & 12 Computer Science (ICS3U, ICS4U) ‚Äì very important for Computer Science programs (obviously).
- Advanced Functions (MHF4U) and Calculus & Vectors (MCV4U) ‚Äì both are required or strongly recommended depending on the university.
- English (ENG4U) ‚Äì required for high school graduation (and therefore university admission).
**Useful Extras:**
- Physics (SPH4U) along with other science or math courses can boost my application and give me a better chance to get into more well known universities.

$$How?$$
To get started on my journey as a software engineer, I would first need to apply to university with OUAC (Ontario Universities‚Äô Application Centre). Strong grades and extracurriculars are strongly prioritized for better chances. Some schools might need more components for my application like an (Admission Information Form) or an interview in rarer cases.

$$Fees?$$
Naturally, university requires a fee to apply. Thankfully, it's just one per three program choices:
There is a $156 base fee for OUAC, 3 programs.
For more choices, it will cost $50 per each.
Other universities (eg. UWaterloo) may charge an additional fee depending on faculty (popularity).

$$Dates & Deadlines$$
The default deadline to apply with OUAC is about mid-January and offers begin as early as February, but most likely during the March to May months. I should be responding to offers by early June.

$$Opportunities$$
Throughout my way leading up to this journey and during it itself, I am presented with many opportunities.
**Self:**
- Tutoring - help others learn and reinforce my own skills.
- Summer jobs/internships - gain real world experience and explore technology careers I might be interested in for the future.
- Freelance coding - take on small projects for experience and income.
- Open source contributions - collaborate on public codebases and networks.
- Personal projects - build apps or tools to show creativity and skills.
- Coding competitions - join contests to challenge myself and earn recognition.
- Tech clubs or meetups - connect with friends, peers, and mentors in tech.

*I've already started on many of these and hope to continue for my next two summers*

**External:**
- Hack the North (Waterloo) ‚Äì Canada‚Äôs largest student hackathon, great for networking with future possible workers and hands on coding experience.
- SHAD Program ‚Äì summer enrichment program focused on STEAM (Science, Tech, Engineering, Arts, Math) and entrepreneurship for high achieving students (such as myself).

*Each of these opportunities will help me grow my skills as training before the field, expand my network, and prepare for greater success in my technology career.*

# Pathway Two - Law
$$Brief Note$$
I'll follow a very similar structure to pathway one in terms of sections and wording, with my individual information updated.

$$High School Courses$$
For law school (unlike other majors like computer science), there is no "pre-law" required courses. Some courses are very helpful for my foundations and acceptance to universities for my undergraduate degree (only requirement).
- English (ENG4U) ‚Äì required for high school graduation (and therefore university admission). Critical for:
-- writing, reading comprehension, and argument structure.
- Canadian and World Studies (eg., Civics [this!], History, Law) ‚Äì helpful for my understanding of society, the government, and legal systems. Important skills made:
-- research, critical and analytical thinking.
- Social Sciences (eg., Philosophy, Politics, Equity Studies) ‚Äì valuable for:
-- building reasoning, ethical decision making, and understanding diverse perspectives.
-- the latter is especially important for criminal law.
- Public Speaking, Debate Club, and Student Leadership ‚Äì excellent for:
-- strengthening my communication and confidence, argumentation, and persuasion abilities.
-- all very important if I am to fix the weaknesses I outlined in "All About Me" (Home)

$$How?$$
Again, unlike other majors, law is no "one-step process". First I'll need an undergraduate degree which could be anything, but common degrees include:
- Political Science
- Philosophy
- Sociology / Criminology

After I have an undergraduate degree, I can write my LSAT (Law School Admission Test), a common test in Canada and the United States of America. If I pass, I can apply to Law School (eg. JD at UofT or Osgoode at York).

Finally, after having all my certifications, I must become licensed. I'll take the "Bar Exam" and do my "articling" (working under a licensed lawyer for ~12 months.)

$$Fees?$$
- $156 base fee for OUAC, 3 programs.
- LSAT costs ~300 CAD per attempt.
- Law school applications with OLSAS (similar to OUAC but for law school) - ~$150 base + ~$100 per school.
- Extra fees may come in for licensing with things like the Bar Exam and articling.

$$Dates & Deadlines$$
- OUAC - same timing as other programs
- LSAT - multiple times per year
- OLSAS - due early november

$$Opportunities$$
Throughout my way pursuing law, I have a plethora of possible activities to do.
**Self:**
- Debate club ‚Äì practice argumentation, public speaking, and critical thinking.
- Mock trials ‚Äì experience courtroom procedures and legal reasoning (available in Law class at my highschool).

**External:**
- Volunteering with legal aid organizations ‚Äì gain exposure to real-world legal issues (and possibly connections + letters of recommendation).

**Not Available for Me:**
- Student government ‚Äì develop leadership and advocacy skills (while making a difference).

# Financial Literacy
$$Expenses$$
Most career pathways require many expensive costs, especially for more specialized programs like law and medical. Enrollment, tuition, books, tests, and more can all add up to thousands of dollars in expenses before you even start the job. **For example: UofT**
- Enrollment  
-- comp. sci. - $1,000 (first year fees)  
-- law (in total) - $1,000 (approximate first year fees)  
- Tuition  
-- comp. sci. - $15,000 per year (domestic undergraduate)  
-- law (in total) - $36,000 per year (domestic JD program)  
- Books  
-- comp. sci. - $1,000 per year  
-- law (in total) - $1,500 per year

*Other fees can be seen in the individual pathway*

**Total cost for Comp. Sci.**
__~$16,250+ per year__

**Total cost for Law**
__~$37,750 per year__

$$Payment$$
As you can see, both programs can be very expensive, especially law. I plan to pay for most of my postsecondary opportunity costs with an RESP that my parents have started and funded for me. I also aim for a scholarship if possible if I get the opportunity to receive one.

**Extra Info:**
For those who don't know what an RESP is, it stands for Registered Education Savings Plan. It's a long-term savings plan that aims to help parents save money for a child's education after high school. It is extremely useful for lowering the cost. You can read more about it at <Canada.ca | https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/education/education-savings.html>.

$$Scholarships, Bursaries & Grants$$
Here are two examples of scholarships/bursaries/grants I would be eligible for. You can easily find these by talking to your teachers or looking online:

1. **BBPA National Scholarship Fund**  
"One of such programs, the BBPA National Scholarship Program (NSP) was established in 1986 and is dedicated to supporting and promoting the achievement of academic excellence by Black Canadian youth through an annual scholarship program. It was borne out of the need to reduce the rate at which Black students drop out of school despite their rising intellect, due to unavailability of funds." Read more at <BBPA.org | https://bbpa.org/bbpa-scholarships/>.

1. **Toronto Community Housing Scholarship Program**  
As a resident in the GTA, this scholarship could be useful to me: "We believe that giving young residents the opportunity to attend a postsecondary education or training institution will empower them to become young leaders who will improve their communities." Read more at <Toronto Community Housing | https://torontohousing.ca/programs-and-tenant-engagement/scholarships>.

*Both of these amazing opportunities are useful and available to me should I need them.*

$$Residence$$
Staying at home and moving out are both viable options for those who can afford it, and of course there's pros and cons to everything. From my view, moving out is best.

**Staying at Home**
- Pros
-- lower costs and living expenses (parents usually pay for utilities and don't charge rent)
-- family support and comfort to help you if you need
-- easy to focus on studies without worrying about chores or other distractions
- Cons
-- less independence and chance for personal growth
-- possibly distractions from your family themselves
-- limited social opportunities that could give you a break

**Moving Out**
- Pros
-- more independence and responsibility
-- helps you learn necessary life skills (eg. cooking, budgeting, time management, etc.)
-- more social opportunities and networking so you can make connections
- Cons
-- higher cost of living (you have to pay rent, utilities, groceries, etc.)
-- manage all chores and other household tasks (time consuming)
-- may make you feel lonely or homesick if this is your first time alone or you're new.

$$All About Me$$
Hey, welcome to my personal blog site for my civics & careers class. My name is Jahvon Cockburn, I am 15 years old and I'm attending high school in grade 10. Growing up in multiple cities, I've been exposed to multiple languages (mainly both English and French) through diverse environments. These experiences have enriched my background and given me the opportunity to find new interests and turn me into who I am today. My biggest interest, computers, started early in my life during just the second grade. The computer program by MIT, "Scratch", sparked a deep enthusiasm for coding that continues to grow as I get older and learn more. I learn best with visual and kinesthetic styles, which help me with my very motivated, curious, and opportunistic personality. I aim to continue to grow personally and academically in the coming years.

$$Personality$$
After taking the Myers-Briggs 16 Personalities test, I have concluded that I have the type ENTP-A (Assertive, Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Perceiving). Intellectual and creative problem solving challenges are all very enjoyable for me, and help me thrive to become better, especially when related to technology (or more specifically coding). Sharing my ideas is easy for me with my natural outgoing and confident nature, but it may lead to me being **too** passionate or blunt when I debate with others. I'm always energetic and enthusiastic when faced with new challenges or ideas, but if I'm **overly** passionate, I'll come off as insensitive about some topics. Overall, I find great strength that prepares me for my future innovative, strategical, and creative careers, but I also know my weaknesses and how I can work on myself. 

$$Interests & Hobbies$$
I have a lot of interests! People that know me well understand that I dabble in all sorts of skills, making me a very well rounded person, but like every other human, I have some focus.

**Main Passion - Coding**
Fluent in:
- Scratch (My first)
- Python (My best)
- JavaScript & Typescript (My most used)
- Golang (Short & Quick projects [yet efficient])
- Java (Robotics)
- Always learning more!

**Other Interests:**
- Engineering, crafting, building, etc.
- Biking, walking, swimming and all active outdoors activities
- Volunteering in any way I can. (Hoping to build as many hours as I can for fun!)
- Language learning ([DUO STREAK] day streak on Duolingo). Currently exploring German and improving my French.

$$Awards and Certifications$$
- üèÜ Solo Hackathon Winner ‚Äì I won my school's first ever hackathon in grade six, standing out from the competition. I won a brand new Raspberry Pi 4 which I continue to use often for side-projects.
- üèÜ Oware Tournament Champion ‚Äì My school board's Oware tournament. I ended up victorious over a board-wide contest of 60 students.

- üìú Certificate of Distinction ‚Äì from the University of Waterloo‚Äôs Canadian Computing Competition (CCC), recognizing high achievement in programming skills. Top 25%.

# Pathway One - Computer Science
$$High School Courses$$
To pursue my Computer Science pathway, I'll need to (or I'm recommended to) take various courses including:
- Grade 11 & 12 Computer Science (ICS3U, ICS4U) ‚Äì very important for Computer Science programs (obviously).
- Advanced Functions (MHF4U) and Calculus & Vectors (MCV4U) ‚Äì both are required or strongly recommended depending on the university.
- English (ENG4U) ‚Äì required for high school graduation (and therefore university admission).
**Useful Extras:**
- Physics (SPH4U) along with other science or math courses can boost my application and give me a better chance to get into more well known universities.

$$How?$$
To get started on my journey as a software engineer, I would first need to apply to university with OUAC (Ontario Universities‚Äô Application Centre). Strong grades and extracurriculars are strongly prioritized for better chances. Some schools might need more components for my application like an (Admission Information Form) or an interview in rarer cases.

$$Fees?$$
Naturally, university requires a fee to apply. Thankfully, it's just one per three program choices:
There is a $156 base fee for OUAC, 3 programs.
For more choices, it will cost $50 per each.
Other universities (eg. UWaterloo) may charge an additional fee depending on faculty (popularity).

Prices are always updated at <OUAC.ca | https://www.ouac.on.ca/guide/undergrad-fees/>

$$Dates & Deadlines$$
The default deadline to apply with OUAC is about mid-January and offers begin as early as February, but most likely during the March to May months. I should be responding to offers by early June.

$$Opportunities$$
Throughout my way leading up to this journey and during it itself, I am presented with many opportunities.
**Self:**
- Tutoring - help others learn and reinforce my own skills.
- Summer jobs/internships - gain real world experience and explore technology careers I might be interested in for the future.
- Freelance coding - take on small projects for experience and income.
- Open source contributions - collaborate on public codebases and networks.
- Personal projects - build apps or tools to show creativity and skills.
- Coding competitions - join contests to challenge myself and earn recognition.
- Tech clubs or meetups - connect with friends, peers, and mentors in tech.

*I've already started on many of these and hope to continue for my next two summers*

**External:**
- Hack the North (Waterloo) ‚Äì Canada‚Äôs largest student hackathon, great for networking with future possible workers and hands on coding experience.
- SHAD Program ‚Äì summer enrichment program focused on STEAM (Science, Tech, Engineering, Arts, Math) and entrepreneurship for high achieving students (such as myself).

*Each of these opportunities will help me grow my skills as training before the field, expand my network, and prepare for greater success in my technology career.*

# Pathway Two - Law
$$Brief Note$$
I'll follow a very similar structure to pathway one in terms of sections and wording, with my individual information updated.

$$High School Courses$$
For law school (unlike other majors like computer science), there are no "pre-law" required courses. Some courses are very helpful for my foundations and acceptance to universities for my undergraduate degree (only requirement).
- English (ENG4U) ‚Äì required for high school graduation (and therefore university admission). Critical for:
-- writing, reading comprehension, and argument structure.
- Canadian and World Studies (eg., Civics [this!], History, Law) ‚Äì helpful for my understanding of society, the government, and legal systems. Important skills made:
-- research, critical and analytical thinking.
- Social Sciences (eg., Philosophy, Politics, Equity Studies) ‚Äì valuable for:
-- building reasoning, ethical decision making, and understanding diverse perspectives.
-- the latter is especially important for criminal law.
- Public Speaking, Debate Club, and Student Leadership ‚Äì excellent for:
-- strengthening my communication and confidence, argumentation, and persuasion abilities.
-- all very important if I am to fix the weaknesses I outlined in "All About Me" (Home)

$$How?$$
Again, unlike other majors, law is no "one-step process". First I'll need an undergraduate degree which could be anything, but common degrees include:
- Political Science
- Philosophy
- Sociology / Criminology

After I have an undergraduate degree, I can write my LSAT (Law School Admission Test), a common test in Canada and the United States of America. If I pass, I can apply to Law School (eg. JD at UofT or Osgoode at York).

Finally, after having all my certifications, I must become licensed. I'll take the "Bar Exam" and do my "articling" (working under a licensed lawyer for ~12 months.)

[https://www.osgoode.yorku.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Arriving-DSC_0580_H.jpg]

$$Fees?$$
- $156 base fee for OUAC, 3 programs.
- LSAT costs ~300 CAD per attempt.
- Law school applications with OLSAS (similar to OUAC but for law school) - ~$150 base + ~$100 per school.
- Extra fees may come in for licensing with things like the Bar Exam and articling.

Again, prices for law can be found at <OUAC.ca | https://www.ouac.on.ca/guide/olsas-fees/>

$$Dates & Deadlines$$
- OUAC - same timing as other programs
- LSAT - multiple times per year
- OLSAS - due early november

$$Opportunities$$
Throughout my way pursuing law, I have a plethora of possible activities to do.
**Self:**
- Debate club ‚Äì practice argumentation, public speaking, and critical thinking.
- Mock trials ‚Äì experience courtroom procedures and legal reasoning (available in Law class at my highschool).

**External:**
- Volunteering with legal aid organizations ‚Äì gain exposure to real-world legal issues (and possibly connections + letters of recommendation).

**Not Available for Me:**
- Student government ‚Äì develop leadership and advocacy skills (while making a difference).

# Financial Literacy
$$Expenses$$
Most career pathways require many expensive costs, especially for more specialized programs like law and medical. Enrollment, tuition, books, tests, and more can all add up to thousands of dollars in expenses before you even start the job. **For example: UofT**
- Enrollment  
-- comp. sci. - $1,000 (first year fees)  
-- law (in total) - $1,000 (approximate first year fees)  
- Tuition  
-- comp. sci. - $15,000 per year (domestic undergraduate)  
-- law (in total) - $36,000 per year (domestic JD program)  
- Books  
-- comp. sci. - $1,000 per year  
-- law (in total) - $1,500 per year

*Other fees can be seen in the individual pathway*

**Total cost for Comp. Sci.**
__~$16,250+ per year__

**Total cost for Law**
__~$37,750 per year__

*Keep in mind that law includes an **extra** school so fees are obviously significantly more*

$$Payment$$
As you can see, both programs can be very expensive, especially law. I plan to pay for most of my postsecondary opportunity costs with an RESP that my parents have started and funded for me. I also aim for a scholarship if possible if I get the opportunity to receive one.

**Extra Info:**
For those who don't know what an RESP is, it stands for Registered Education Savings Plan. It's a long-term savings plan that aims to help parents save money for a child's education after high school. It is extremely useful for lowering the cost. You can read more about it at <Canada.ca | https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/education/education-savings.html>.

$$Scholarships, Bursaries & Grants$$
Here are two examples of scholarships/bursaries/grants I would be eligible for. You can easily find these by talking to your teachers or looking online:

1. **BBPA National Scholarship Fund**  
"One of such programs, the BBPA National Scholarship Program (NSP) was established in 1986 and is dedicated to supporting and promoting the achievement of academic excellence by Black Canadian youth through an annual scholarship program. It was borne out of the need to reduce the rate at which Black students drop out of school despite their rising intellect, due to unavailability of funds." Read more at <BBPA.org | https://bbpa.org/bbpa-scholarships/>.

2. **Toronto Community Housing Scholarship Program**  
As a resident in the GTA, this scholarship could be useful to me: "We believe that giving young residents the opportunity to attend a postsecondary education or training institution will empower them to become young leaders who will improve their communities." Read more at <Toronto Community Housing | https://torontohousing.ca/programs-and-tenant-engagement/scholarships>.

3. **TD Scholarships for Community Leadership**  
"Since 1995, TD has awarded millions in TD Scholarships for Community Leadership to recognize students who have demonstrated an outstanding commitment to community leadership. TD Scholarships for Community Leadership recipients receive up to $70,000 for tuition and living expenses as well as opportunities for paid summer employment, peer networking and mentorship." Learn more at <TD Scholarships for Community Leadership | https://www.td.com/ca/en/personal-banking/solutions/student-banking/community-leadership-scholarship-for-canadians>.

4. **Schulich Leader Scholarships**  
"Schulich Leader Scholarships are Canada‚Äôs most coveted undergraduate STEM scholarships. One hundred are awarded to entrepreneurial-minded high school graduates enrolling in a Science, Technology, Engineering or Math program at 20 partner universities across Canada." Learn more at <Schulich Leaders | https://schulichleaders.com/>.

*All of these amazing opportunities are useful and available to me should I need them.*

$$Residence$$
Staying at home and moving out are both viable options for those who can afford it, and of course there's pros and cons to everything. From my view, moving out is best.

**Staying at Home**
- Pros
-- lower costs and living expenses (parents usually pay for utilities and don't charge rent)
-- family support and comfort to help you if you need
-- easy to focus on studies without worrying about chores or other distractions
- Cons
-- less independence and chance for personal growth
-- possibly distractions from your family themselves
-- limited social opportunities that could give you a break

**Moving Out**
- Pros
-- more independence and responsibility
-- helps you learn necessary life skills (eg. cooking, budgeting, time management, etc.)
-- more social opportunities and networking so you can make connections
- Cons
-- higher cost of living (you have to pay rent, utilities, groceries, etc.)
-- manage all chores and other household tasks (time consuming)
-- may make you feel lonely or homesick if this is your first time alone or you're new.

# Starting Career (Computer Science)
$$Average Salary & Wage$$
The salary for a computer science degree can vary, but for most people the salary and wage is high. 

The lowest division of wages is __$23,500 - $44,499__ for the bottom 20% with a wage of __$22.50/h__. The 90th percentile is a huge jump to __$222,000__ at __$106/h__, with the rest being outliers. The average salary in Ontario for a computer science degree is __$102,643__ at __$49/h__.

$$Duties$$
As a software engineer or developer, my main duties would vary depending on the company and field, but in general they would include:

- Designing, writing, and testing the code for applications, websites, or systems.
- Working with others on a team to define project requirements and effectively create strong solutions for clients.
- Debugging and troubleshooting my own or other people's code.
- Keeping up to date with new (work related) technology and frameworks to be modern.
- Mentoring junior developers (new workers) if I have high levels of experience.

$$Environment$$
Most jobs in the computer science field allow hybrid or fully remote working. In simple terms, this means that I can work from both home and in the office during mixed days of the week. Remote working has many perks, though so does office. For example:

**Remote Work**
- Pros
-- flexible schedule and location so I can work anywhere I want with internet access (more comfortable).
-- no commute, wake up late and still be efficient.
-- better work-life balance so if I ever have a family I can balance my time better.
- Cons
-- depending on how you work, there can be more distractions at home (though I find there's less personally.)
-- harder to separate work and personal life (eg. work can leak into home time more often.)

**In-Person Work**
- Pros
-- easier to collaborate and talk with other team members
-- strong separation between work and home
-- networking and social opportunity
- Cons
-- commute to work is expensive and time consuming depending on location (eg. you live far away).
-- less flexible for your schedule and location
-- less distractions depending on how you work

$$Potential Stress$$
Computer science can be a stressful degree to earn and includes stressful work. One stress I might encounter is having tight deadlines and a high workload. Most projects for clients have very strict deadlines as everything needs to be completed for something else. Longer hours and extra pressure to deliver these results well, especially in scenarios where you find bugs, are both common factors to most workers. Keeping up with new and rapidly changing technology is also a common issue. In this new *"era of AI"*, things change a lot. New programming languages, frameworks, and tools are all necessary to stay up to date and be modern so you don't risk losing your job to someone better.

# Life Goals - A 10 Year Plan
$$Introduction$$
Now that you know all about me and how I'm planning out my future, I've devised a 10 year plan to guide me along my journey. I'll talk about various topics like my work, travel, family, and finances. Enjoy!

$$Career$$
For the first **one to three years** of my career, I'll be a junior developer. This just means I'm new to the field and have much to learn from others. I aim to work at a tech company (or startup if logical), focusing on building my skills in the most modern technologies so I'm future-ready. Working with teams, building projects, and learning new tools will all give me **important** real world experience that is required for my sustainable future. Depending on where I am in a few years, I'll decide between front-end or back-end coding, or even both if I can handle it.

After those years, at approximately **three to six years** into my future, I'll be a "mid level" developer where I've gained some experience and I'm ready to jump into more responsibilities and opportunities. I'll focus on continuing to build my portfolio and do hackathons to build a resume.

My years of preparation before will make me ready for my highest level of work where I'll be a sort of "specialist" or "senior" as most people call it (**six to 10 years**). I'll be working on larger scale projects and likely leading a team (or a few).

$$Travel$$
I do love Canada, but I might not necessarily want to live here forever. Over the years I've considered different countries or provinces to live in, mainly Germany, Quebec, and the USA. Depending on how my career goes and my opportunities at the time, I might make a move.

For the first **five years** of when I'm ready, I'll choose a tech hub in my location of choice so that I have good opportunities for work. For example, *Berlin* for Germany, *Montreal* for Quebec, or *San Francisco*, USA. If I'm enjoying my lifestyle there and my evaluation of my job chances work well, I'll make the move permanent and continue my career there.

$$Family$$
I'm still unsure about my plans for a family. The next decade of my life will bring important decisions that I must make around relationships and other long-term commitments. As my career grows and stabilizes, there's of course a chance that I decide to settle down and even maybe have kids, but nothing is for sure as it depends on many different factors.

$$Finances$$
I most **definitely** want to invest early and save aggressively so I'm prepared for **everything**, especially considering I might move to a new country. Contributing to my RRSP (if I plan to stay in Canada) and buying stocks, bonds, or even real estate depending on the state of the country are all feasible and important.

For the **fifth to tenth years** I'll keep working on myself to aim for a salary in the range of $80,000-$100,000 as a "mid level" developer. My location and expertise will all be factors and with experience, I can possibly aim to earn even higher.

$$Personal Development$$
This section is a little unordered, but is very important. For all **10 years**, I plan to continue with my career development and everything I mentioned before, but with an extra two sections.

- Making high level connections
-- building a personal brand
-- networking at conferences
-- adding to tech blogs and open source projects

- Languages
-- continuing to study French & German, very important if I move.

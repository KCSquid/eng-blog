# Summary
A dystopian future just past the brink of an environmental collapse, North America is being destroyed by an unknown phenomenon: many people have lost the ability to $$dream$$, **but the Indigenous still can**. Canada’s new department of Oneirology works to hunt down the targets for their bone marrow, the only desperate solution to cure the dreamlessness.

Our story follows *Frenchie*, the main character. Frenchie is a young Metis man who adventures through the forest as he and a group of fellow survivors travel north. *Miigwans*, their wise protector, takes them through, teaching him and the others about his $$heritage$$, $$culture$$, and most importantly, $$community$$.

Frenchie encounters difficulties all throughout his story as he journeys up towards the rumored sanctuary. The group is always in danger whether it be through the Recruiters relentlessness to hunt them down, internal conflicts like their fear or emotion, and losses that left meaningful impacts on the group. Frenchie works his best to take control of his feelings though he is always burdened with him not knowing his identity and losing his family at the start. The group works together as one community, showing off their resilience and determination to survive.

This book presents many minor themes though it follows one large one: the ongoing and past __exploitation__ and __genocide__ of the Indigenous people. This book highlights the importance of preserving your $$cultures$$ and $$traditions$$ even through hardship. This novel provides a powerful testament to the endurance of the human spirit, especially historically the Indigenous communities and their unwavering hope for a future where everyone is equal and dreams can *really come true*.

# Why you should read this book
Hello readers around the world, my job here today is to talk to you about a book I really love with a message that will stay with you long after you finish it, The Marrow Thieves. The Marrow Thieves is a book by Cherie Dimaline about a future with environmental disaster caused by humans with the consequence that their dreaming has been lost, all except by the indigenous. After research, they discovered the only way to bring back the dreaming is to hunt down the indigenous for their bone marrow, holding the key to restoring dreams.

This book isn’t just another dystopian novel, but instead a powerful story about resilience, community, family, struggle, and more exciting yet depressing topics. The captivating style of this book, focusing on the development of characters and their individual struggles make this book so strong in teaching a lesson: “Though we may be different, we are all human and nobody is better than another”. The writing of Dimaline is beautiful and scary, bringing you into the book so well that you feel it. After reading, my view has changed about how beautiful the world is and how much we must appreciate others, even if they’re different to us or have something we don’t.

Please, I urge you to pick the book for a quick read with an impact that will last forever, $$Miigwetch$$, thank you.

# Questions for the Author
Throughout my reading of this book, I came up with 3 unanswered open-ended questions that I would love to ask the author. These questions were:
- “What was your inspiration to write this story and what impact do you hope to leave on your readers?”
- “How did you come up with such a complex concept and deliver it clearly?”
- “If you were to write a sequel, what direction would you take the story and which characters would you focus on developing further?”

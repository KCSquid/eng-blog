# Summary
A dystopian future just past the brink of an environmental collapse, North America is being destroyed by an unknown phenomenon: many people have lost the ability to $$dream$$, **but the Indigenous still can**. Canada’s new department of Oneirology works to hunt down the targets for their bone marrow, the only desperate solution to cure the dreamlessness.

Our story follows *Frenchie*, the main character. Frenchie is a young Metis man who adventures through the forest as he and a group of fellow survivors travel north. *Miigwans*, their wise protector, takes them through, teaching him and the others about his $$heritage$$, $$culture$$, and most importantly, $$community$$.

Frenchie encounters difficulties all throughout his story as he journeys up towards the rumored sanctuary. The group is always in danger whether it be through the Recruiters relentlessness to hunt them down, internal conflicts like their fear or emotion, and losses that left meaningful impacts on the group. Frenchie works his best to take control of his feelings though he is always burdened with him not knowing his identity and losing his family at the start. The group works together as one community, showing off their resilience and determination to survive.

This book presents many minor themes though it follows one large one: the ongoing and past __exploitation__ and __genocide__ of the Indigenous people. This book highlights the importance of preserving your $$cultures$$ and $$traditions$$ even through hardship. This novel provides a powerful testament to the endurance of the human spirit, especially historically the Indigenous communities and their unwavering hope for a future where everyone is equal and dreams can *really come true*.

# News Report
## BREAKING NEWS: Indigenous Group Spotted Near Northern Territory

**By Jahvon Cockburn**
**June 1, 2025**
A recent development in the bone marrow case has caught the attention of the people in Canada’s Department of Oneirology. A group of Indigenous were sighted reportedly moving through a dense forest within the Northern Territory. An estimated count of 8-10 was likely, observed by surveillance cameras yesterday evening.

The Department confirms two older individuals and several younger members following along. "We have reason to believe these are some of the individuals evading our medical research facilities," stated Dr. Marcus Henderson, head of the Department's Research Division. "Their capture is crucial for continuing our dream restoration program."

Recruiters have been recently dispatched to the area to track the steps of the group, though the dense forest terrain creates challenges through searching. Any suspicious activity in nearby communities is strongly urged to be reported as soon as possible.

"The ability to dream is a fundamental human right," Dr. Henderson added. "These individuals hold the key to restoring this essential function to the rest of humanity. Their cooperation is vital for the greater good."

The Department adds that holding or helping any Indigenous individuals in any way is a felony and will be punished with serious consequences. Updates follow as more is learned about the situation.

*For reporting of Indigenous sightings, contact the Department's hotline at 1-800-DREAMS.*

# An Interview with Frenchie
I’ve decided I want to Frenchie because he is the main character and *obviously* there is the most information on him. My interview is like Dateline as it feels most natural to me and is best for an open-ended interview. Since Frenchie isn't really here right now, I'll show my questions and leave his answers out separately.

$$Interview$$
Welcome and thank you so much for joining me today and asking all the questions we’ve been dying to hear. We really feel your perspective will make a big impact on us and the background of the story.

1. The Marrow Trade, the biggest theme of the book, was witnessed firsthand by you. What can you tell us about the **emotional** and **psychological** toll it took on you __and__ your community?

2. I would think Miigwans serves as a father figure to you and an obvious leader in your group. Do you agree with this?
- Follow up: How has the guidance and wisdom he's shared help you to understand more about your heritage and constant fight?

3. We've all seen the impact Rose has in your life with your relationship evolving throughout the book. Has (and how has) she impacted your understanding of various topics like love and loss along with a connection with someone else being important in an otherwise lonely world?

4. Your journey had allies and enemies through various points of the book. What factors lead you to understand who you can trust?
- Follow up: When you've been tricked into trusting an enemy, what lessons have you learned from them?

5. What would you say was the main driving factor for your fight for survival. Obviously it's to stay alive but more than that, what do *you* want?
- Follow up: What would you be willing to sacrifice for your dream?

6. For the other people who aren't indigenous, what do you think is the most important thing for people to understand?

7. Looking into the future, what message do you hope your story brings towards the future children about resilience and the importance of preserving your culture?

Thank you for answering these. Your insight is invaluable. Good luck on your journey!

# Why you should read this book
Hello readers around the world, my job here today is to talk to you about a book I really love with a message that will stay with you long after you finish it, The Marrow Thieves. The Marrow Thieves is a book by Cherie Dimaline about a future with environmental disaster caused by humans with the consequence that their dreaming has been lost, all except by the indigenous. After research, they discovered the only way to bring back the dreaming is to hunt down the indigenous for their bone marrow, holding the key to restoring dreams.

This book isn’t just another dystopian novel, but instead a powerful story about resilience, community, family, struggle, and more exciting yet depressing topics. The captivating style of this book, focusing on the development of characters and their individual struggles make this book so strong in teaching a lesson: “Though we may be different, we are all human and nobody is better than another”. The writing of Dimaline is beautiful and scary, bringing you into the book so well that you feel it. After reading, my view has changed about how beautiful the world is and how much we must appreciate others, even if they’re different to us or have something we don’t.

Please, I urge you to pick the book for a quick read with an impact that will last forever, $$Miigwetch$$, thank you.

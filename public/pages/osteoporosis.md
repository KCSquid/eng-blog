# Introduction


In this article, me and my partner Jahvon researched the disease known as Osteoporosis and its effects on our bodies. Its link between our diet and some foods worsen and prevent this and lastly some additional facts. Thank you for joining us and let's get into it!

# What is Osteoporosis?

Osteoporosis is a long-lasting condition which is known for its low bone mass and deterioration of bone tissue, leading to increased bone fragility and a higher risk of fractures. It develops gradually over many years and often goes unnoticed until a fracture occurs, commonly in the **hip, spine, wrist or waist**. {http://medlineplus.gov/osteoporosis.html|2025}



Osteoporosis means “porous bone”. It is a metabolic bone disease in which the bones become weak and brittle due to an imbalance between bone resorption (breakdown) and bone formation. **Normally, bone tissue is constantly renewed, but in osteoporosis, the rate of bone loss exceeds bone formation, resulting in decreased bone density.** {http://www.britannica.com/science/osteoporosis|2025}

# How Does this Disease Affect The Body?

The main effect of osteoporosis is a reduction in bone mineral density, which makes bones more fragile. The internal structure of bone tissue becomes thin and porous, especially in the trabecular (spongy) bone found in the spine and hips. **Even minor falls or stresses can cause fractures. It can also lead to chronic back pain, loss of height and bad posture.** {https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.48582 | 2023} Hormonal changes like decreased estrogen in postmenopausal women, low calcium/vitamin D levels, as well as having trouble with immobility, independence and overall quality of life, not to mention the increased mortality rate. (Samruddhi H Charde et al., 2023)

# Facts:

Hip fractures due to osteoporosis are a serious problem for seniors. Mortality is significantly increased after hip fracture, and fewer than 50 % suffering from this injury experience functional recovery, and many are permanently disabled. **About 25 % of patients reside in long-term care facilities for a year or more after a hip fracture.** {http://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/healthy-living/your-health/diseases/seniors-aging-osteoporosis.html | 2023}

“Up to 1 in 2 women will break a bone due to osteoporosis, equal to the risk of breast, ovarian and uterine cancer combined. **Up to 1 in 4 men will break a bone due to osteoporosis, a risk greater than prostate cancer.”** {http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/osteoporosis | 2023}

# What is The Link Between the Disease & Diet?

- *A balanced diet provides calcium, vitamin D, and protein for bone health*
- *high-salt diets can lead to calcium loss and bone weakness*
- *High caffeine intake can increase the amount of calcium lost in urine*

# What Are The Specific Foods/Habits Of Eating Associated With The Disease?

A lack of calcium, vitamin D, and protein can all be causes of osteoporosis. To significantly lower your chance of obtaining it, eating a balanced diet with nutrients that make your bones strong is highly recommended. Staying away from bad habits like smoking or the excessive consumption of alcohol is also very important as they can weaken both your bones and your body.

# What Foods/Habits Of Eating Could Lead To The Prevention Of This Disease?

**Calcium**
- **Dairy**
-- *Low-fat milk, yogurt, cheese*
- **Dark leafy greens**
-- *Collard greens, kale, broccoli, turnip greens*
*(Note: Spinach is high in calcium but also oxalates, which inhibit calcium absorption, so it shouldn't be counted as a primary source.)*
- **Fish with bones**
-- *Sardines and salmon*
*(The tiny, soft bones are edible and a great source of calcium.)*
**Vitamin D**
- **Fatty fish**
-- *Salmon, mackerel, tuna, sardines*
- **Egg yolks.**
- **Misc**
-- *Milk, some yogurts, orange juice, cereals*
-- *Sunlight*
**Protein**
- **Plant-based**
-- *beans, nuts, seeds, tofu*
- **lean meats, poultry, fish, low-fat dairy products.**

# Conclusion
So to conclude, osteoporosis is a long-lasting disease that weakens the bones and makes fractures more likely, especially in older adults. It often goes unnoticed until a major injury happens, which can lead to long-term pain, reduced mobility, and even a higher risk of death after serious fractures like those in the hip. Diet plays a major role in bone health, since nutrients like calcium, vitamin D, and protein help keep bones strong, while too much salt or caffeine can actually make bones weaker. Eating foods such as low-fat dairy, leafy greens, fish with edible bones, and getting enough sunlight for vitamin D can help prevent osteoporosis. Including good protein sources like beans, nuts, tofu, and lean meats also supports bone strength. Overall, healthy eating habits and proper nutrition are key to lowering the risk of osteoporosis.

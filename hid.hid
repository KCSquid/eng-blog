1. Family and Relationships

    Exploring Family Dynamics (5–10 years):

        While you may not plan for a family right away, the next decade may bring about some important decisions around relationships and long-term commitments.

        As your career stabilizes, it’s possible you’ll look at settling down or establishing deeper personal relationships, potentially in whichever country you choose to live.

2. Financial and Property Goals

    Early Investments (1–5 years):

        Begin saving aggressively by contributing to your RESP and setting aside money for future endeavors. Look into investments like stocks, bonds, or perhaps real estate if feasible.

        Aim to save up for your first property or apartment, especially if you plan to live in a tech hub like Berlin or Quebec, where the cost of living can vary greatly.

    Salary Goals (5–10 years):

        Aim for a salary in the range of $80,000–$100,000 as a mid-level developer (depending on your location and expertise). With experience, you could aim to earn higher, especially if you move to more expensive tech cities.

        If you eventually move into a remote or freelance role, try to set a target income that provides for both your personal and future investment goals.

3. Personal Development and Learning

    Continuous Learning (All 10 years):

        Stay up to date with new coding languages and frameworks (e.g., React, Node.js, and others), as tech is always evolving. Given your strong interest in coding, continue enhancing your skill set with online courses, certifications, and attending developer conferences.

        Try to push yourself into leadership or mentoring roles, as this will improve both your technical and soft skills.

    High-level Personal Goals (5–10 years):

        Work on building a strong personal brand within the tech community. This might include contributing to well-known tech blogs, speaking at conferences, or leading tech teams in your workplace.

        Continue with your language studies, especially focusing on German and French, which can help with professional communication in your future international moves.
